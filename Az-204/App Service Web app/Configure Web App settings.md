# Configure application settings
Application settings can be accessed by navigating to the app's management page and selecting **Configuration > Application Settings.**
![example](configure-app-settings.png)
these values are the same as setting the `<appSettings>` in the *Web.config* but these settings override the onses in *Web.config* or *appsettings.json*.
# Configure connection strings
For ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core developers the values set in App Setvice override the ones in *Web.config*. For other language stacks, it's better to use app settings instead, because connection strings require special formatting in the variable keys in order to access the values.
# Configure general settings
In the **Configuration > General settings** section you can configure some common settings for your app. Some settings requre to scale up to higher pricing tiers.

 - **Platform settings**: Lets you configure settings for the hosting platform, including:

    - **Bitness**: 32-bit or 64-bit.

    - **WebSocket protocol**: For ASP.NET SignalR or socket.io, for example.

    - **Always On**: Keep the app loaded even when there's no traffic. By default, Always On is not enabled and the app is unloaded after 20 minutes without any incoming requests. It's required for continuous WebJobs or for WebJobs that are triggered using a CRON expression.

    - **Managed pipeline version**: The IIS pipeline mode. Set it to Classic if you have a legacy app that requires an older version of IIS.

    - **HTTP version**: Set to 2.0 to enable support for HTTPS/2 protocol.

    - **ARR affinity**: In a multi-instance deployment, ensure that the client is routed to the same instance for the life of the session. You can set this option to Off for stateless applications.
# Enable diagnosic logging
The table below shows the types of logging, the platforms supported, and where the logs can be stored and located ofr accessing the information.



| Type | Platform | Location | Description|
|------|----------|----------|------------|
| Application logging | Windows, Linux | App Service file system and/or Azure Storage blobs | Logs messages generated by your application |
| Web server logging | Windows | App Service file system or Azure Storage blobs | Raw HTTP request data in the W3C extended log file format. Messages include data like the HTTP method, resource URI, client IP, client port, user agent, response code etc. |
| Detailed error logging | Windows | App Serivce file system or Azure Storage blobs | Copied of the *.htm* error pages that would have been sent to the client browser. |
| Failed requests tracing | Windows | App Service file system | Detailed tracing information on failed requests. |
| Deoployment logging | Windows, Linux | App Service file System | Helps to determinate why a deployment failed. Happens automatically not configurable |
# Stream logs
- Azure CLI - To stream logs live in Cloud Shell use the following command:
```
az webapp log tail --name appname -- resource-group myResourceGroup
```
# Configure security certificates
A certificate is uploaded into an app is stored in a deployment unit that is bound to the app service plan's resource group and region combination. This makes the certificate accessible to other apps in the same resource group and region combination.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| Create a fre app Service managed certificate | Aprivate certificate that's free of charge and easy to use if just need to secure your custom domain in App Service. Custom SSL is not supported in **F1** or **D1** tier. |
| Purchase an App Service certificate | A Private certificate that's managed by Azure. It combines the simplicity of automated certificate management and the flexibility of renewal and export options. |
| Import a certificate from Key Vault | Useful if you use Azure key Vault to manage your certificates. |
| Upload a private certificate | If you already have a private certificate from a third-party provider, you can upload it. |
| Upload a public certificate | Pulic certificates are not used to secure custom domains, but you can load them into your code if you need them to access remote resources |
# Manage app features with feature flags
When a feature flag has multiple filters, the filter list is traversed in order until one of the filters determines the feature should be enabled. At that point, the feature flag is on, and any remaining filter results are skipped. If no filter indicates the feature should be enabled, the feature flag is off.

The feature manager supports appsettings.json as a configuration source for feature flags. The following example shows how to set up feature flags in a JSON file:
```
"FeatureManagement": {
    "FeatureA": true, // Feature flag set to on
    "FeatureB": false, // Feature flag set to off
    "FeatureC": {
        "EnabledFor": [
            {
                "Name": "Percentage",
                "Parameters": {
                    "Value": 50
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Azure App Configuration is designed to be a centralized repository for feature flags.
